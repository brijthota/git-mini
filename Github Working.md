# How GitHub works:
- GitHub builds collaboration directly into the development process. Work is organized into repositories, where developers can outline requirements or direction and set expectations for team members. Then, using the GitHub flow, developers simply create a branch to work on updates, commit changes to save them, open a pull request to propose and discuss changes, and merge pull requests once everyone is on the same page.

# The GitHub flow:

-	The GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow built around core Git commands used by teams around the globe—including ours. 

-	The GitHub flow has six steps, each with distinct benefits when implemented:

**Step 1 :** Create a branch: Topic branches created from the canonical deployment branch (usually master) allow teams to contribute to many parallel efforts. Short-lived topic branches, in particular, keep teams focused and results in quick ships.

**Step 2 :** Add commits: Snapshots of development efforts within a branch create safe, revertible points in the project’s history.

**Step 3 :** Open a pull request: Pull requests publicize a project’s ongoing efforts and set the tone for a transparent development process.

**Step 4 :** Discuss and review code: Teams participate in code reviews by commenting, testing, and reviewing open pull requests. Code review is at the core of an open and participatory culture.

**Step 5 :** Merge: Upon clicking merge, GitHub automatically performs the equivalent of a local ‘git merge’ operation. GitHub also keeps the entire branch development history on the merged pull request.

**Step 6 :** Deploy: Teams can choose the best release cycles or incorporate continuous integration tools and operate with the assurance that code on the deployment branch has gone through a robust workflow.
