# Project Description:

## GIT

Git is a free and open source distributed code management and version control system that is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2. In addition to software version control, Git is used for other applications including configuration management and content management.

## Docker

Docker is a basic tool, like git or java, that you should start incorporating into your daily development and ops practices. Use Docker as version control system for your entire app's operating system. Use Docker when you want to distribute/collaborate on your app's operating system with a team.

## Test automation

Test automation allows your team to execute more tests in less time, increasing coverage and freeing human testers to do more high-level, exploratory testing. Automation is especially beneficial for test cases that are executed repeatedly, such as those for cross-browser and cross-device compatibility, and those that are part of a full or partial regression suite.

## Continuous Integration

Continuous integration (CI) is the software development practice of regularly integrating code changes into a shared code repository. Typically, this would happen at least once or then several times a day (depending on the number of code commits) and this practice encourages committing small changes more often over committing large changes infrequently. Each commit triggers a build during which tests are run that help to identify if anything was broken by the changes.
